This portfolio contains the following projects:

Wave function collapse (12/05/2023): inspired by a coding challenge from "The Coding Train" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rI_y2GAlQFM). Procedurally generates an image using set tile connection rules.

Hangman (27/12/2023): the game uses a Tkinter UI with turtle for the hangman graphic.

Rank Tree (12/02/2025): system to rank items by user preference as efficiently as possible. It uses a self-balancing AVL tree that I had learned about as part of my Artificial Intelligence module to ensure the user made the least number of comparisons between a new item and an item in the tree to place it.
