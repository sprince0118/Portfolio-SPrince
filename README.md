Any university projects are not present in this repository due to concerns with plagarism.
All projects contained are personal projects with the excepiton of Orbital Mechanics Simulator, which was done as my A Level NEA.

This portfolio contains the following projects:

**Wave function collapse** (12/05/2023): inspired by a coding challenge from "The Coding Train" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rI_y2GAlQFM). Procedurally generates an image using set tile connection rules.

**Hangman** (27/12/2023): the game uses a Tkinter UI with turtle for the hangman graphic.

**Orbital Mechanics Simulator** (29/03/2024): completed as part of my A Level in computer science, this project recieved full marks. Hosted on itch.io: https://orbitalmechanicssimulator.itch.io/simulation

**Show Ranking/Analysis** (19/08/2024): program that allows users to see statistics of shows/films they have watched and compare their ranking (done in tiers from S-F), genre and related themes.

**Rank Tree** (12/02/2025): system to rank items by user preference as efficiently as possible. It uses a self-balancing AVL tree that I had learned about as part of my Artificial Intelligence module to ensure the user made the least number of comparisons between a new item and an item in the tree to place it.
